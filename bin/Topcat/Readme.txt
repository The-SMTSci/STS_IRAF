The 'topcat' script cd's to where I stored the download for topcat.

The launcher runs the commnad. Here the -f switch allows you to

Change the filenames as needed.


/home/wayne/bin/topcat -f csv /home/wayne/Observations/Data/Chile_8_June_2025.csv -f csv /home/wayne/Observations/Data/A0V_6_c2024.csv
